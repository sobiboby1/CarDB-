CarDB:
CarDB is a web application designed to efficiently manage car Database. The application allows users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a car database. Users can add new cars to the system, view the current list of cars, update details for specific cars, and delete cars from the list as needed.

The app features:

Add New Cars: Easily input and store details of new cars.
View All Cars: Displays the complete list of cars in the database.
Update Car Information: Modify details of existing cars using their unique identifiers.
Delete Cars: Remove cars from the database when no longer needed.
Dynamic Web Interface: The car list is rendered dynamically using EJS templates for a seamless user experience.
Built using Express.js and EJS, the project demonstrates how to handle routing, manage a simple in-memory car database, and perform basic server-side rendering. This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of back-end development and managing data with RESTful APIs.
